# Remix with UnoCSS example

This repository shows how you might configure a Remix application to use UnoCSS.

## Explanation

We follow a similar setup to the suggested [Tailwind setup from the Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling#tailwind-css). We use the Uno CLI to generate a CSS file that is then imported in `root.tsx` and used in the `links` function to create a stylesheet link.
